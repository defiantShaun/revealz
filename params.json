{"name":"Revealz_geography","tagline":"A simple adaptation of Reveal.js that assumes you want to have your whole presentation in one md file","body":"So... this is basically Reveal.js, but with the Grunt/Node stuff stripped out.\r\n\r\n[Demo is here](http://aaronr.github.io/revealz)\r\n\r\nI just take a release snapshot of Reveal, stripped out what I did not want.\r\n\r\nMy workflow (and I assume yours as well) is that you want a template presentation to start from, but are not interested in cloning or forking as you will want to change lots of stuff.  So... I just get an archive of the repo, edit some basic stuff, and check it into a new repo.\r\n\r\nTo install:\r\n\r\n    wget https://github.com/aaronr/revealz/archive/master.zip\r\n    unzip master.zip\r\n    mv revealz-master myNewPresentation\r\n    cd myNewPresentation/\r\n\r\nIf you are already on a server in a web accessible directory... just got to the URL and you are rolling.\r\n\r\nTo run a local (port 8000) webserver (to get the markdown includes to work) I just use:\r\n\r\n    python -m SimpleHTTPServer\r\n\r\nEvery server has python... and I like Python.\r\n\r\nGo ahead and check that baby into your new repo and roll...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main idea is that the index.html file has been stripped down, the js config moved to a config.js file, and the FULL presentation content comes from slides.md.\r\n\r\nYou heard me... ALL the slide content is in one file... slides.md\r\n\r\nYou use `--SLIDE--` on a line by itself to indicate the next horizontal slide.  You use `--SUBSLIDE--` on a line by itslef to indicate the next vertical sub-slide.\r\n\r\nYou can just use html comments inline to write notes etc:\r\n\r\n    <!------------------------------------------------------------>\r\n    --SLIDE--\r\n    <!-- Topic: xxx -->\r\n    \r\n    <h1>Slide 15</h1>\r\n    \r\n    --SUBSLIDE--\r\n    \r\n    <h2>Sub Slide 15--1</h2>\r\n\r\nThere is an images directory and you can either use markdown or raw html to embed images etc.\r\n\r\nThats it... pretty basic, but a template for a single markdown page presentation in Reveal.js\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
